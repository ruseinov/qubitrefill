# Pay with most suitable crypto asset in your portfolio

Identify the most suitable crypto in the portfolio (lowest annualised expected return) using a quantum unconstrained binary optimization, settle a Bitrefill product against the cheapest available funding source, then retune the portfolio only if the chosen crypto was actually sold.

Delegates all purchase mechanics to the **Bitrefill MCP** (`mcp__bitrefill__*` tools) — connect it separately (`claude mcp add --transport http bitrefill https://api.bitrefill.com/mcp`, or install the upstream bitrefill plugin which bundles it; <https://github.com/bitrefill/agents>), then invoke it for product search, pricing, buying, and payment polling. This skill adds portfolio seeding, selection logic, and an account-aware funding waterfall on top.

The flow is designed to stop for the user in **exactly one** place — the purchase approval (step 6). Defaults, a config file, and a permission allowlist remove the other interruptions.

## Calling conventions (MCP tools)

The backend is the **qupick MCP server** — the portfolio backend's `/mcp` transport. Its URL is
whatever `.mcp.json` points the `qupick` server at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp` for a local stack,
or a deployed HTTPS endpoint such as `https://qupick.quip.network/mcp`. Drive it with
`mcp__qupick__*` tools — **no `curl`**. The six tools are allowlisted, so none of them prompt:

| Tool | Does |
|------|------|
| `mcp__qupick__ping_backend` | liveness probe (public) |
| `mcp__qupick__register_agent` | create an agent; the API key is **emailed** (public) |
| `mcp__qupick__get_agent` | fetch the authenticated agent's config (basket, sliders) |
| `mcp__qupick__optimize` | optimise / retune the authenticated agent |
| `mcp__qupick__get_market` | live holdings + μ for the authenticated agent |
| `mcp__qupick__get_leaderboard` | scoreboard (public) |

**Auth.** Every per-agent tool (`get_agent`, `optimize`, `get_market`) carries the agent's API
key as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, configured once in `.mcp.json` by pasting the key **literally**
into the header (`"Authorization": "Bearer <key>"`). Claude Code does **not** expand `${VAR}` in
`.mcp.json` headers, so an environment variable won't reach the server — use the literal key from
registration (see step 2). The public tools work without it.

The only `curl` left in this flow is the read-only Bitrefill balance endpoint (step 5b):

```bash
curl https://api.bitrefill.com/v2/accounts/balance -H "Authorization: Bearer $BITREFILL_API_KEY"
```

That one is allowlisted (write the URL first so prefix matching works). Real purchases go through
the Bitrefill MCP's `buy-products`, deliberately **not** allowlisted, so the approval gate in
step 6 always fires.

## Backend tool reference

MCP server: `qupick` (the backend's `/mcp` transport — local `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp` or the
deployed URL configured in `.mcp.json`). Tools return JSON; a failed
per-agent call surfaces the backend's `{"detail": "..."}` (e.g. `401` when the `.mcp.json` Bearer key
is unset/wrong, `422` on validation, `503` on no feasible solution).

### `register_agent` — create agent (public)

**Arguments** (`name`, `email`, `sliders` all required):
```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "email": "you@example.com",
  "handle": "string | null",
  "sliders": {
    "rebalanceFrequency": 50,
    "riskPreference": 50,
    "maxPositionSize": 50
  },
  "assets": ["BTC", "ETH", "..."]
}
```

`email` is **required and unique**. `SliderValues` — **all three required**, each 0–100:
- `rebalanceFrequency` — how often the agent rebalances (0 = rarely, 100 = hourly max)
- `riskPreference` — risk-aversion term γ (0 = conservative, 100 = aggressive)
- `maxPositionSize` — per-asset weight cap (0 = equal-weight 1/n, 100 = up to ~50% in one asset)

Default sensible values when the user hasn't expressed a preference: `{"rebalanceFrequency": 50, "riskPreference": 50, "maxPositionSize": 50}`.

**Returns** (`RegistrationResponse`) — the API key is **emailed, never returned**:
```json
{
  "message": "Check your email for your API key.",
  "email": "you@example.com",
  "bankroll": 10000.0
}
```

In local dev (no `SMTP_PASSWORD` on the backend) the key is **printed to the backend console**:
`[email:console] API key for <name> <<email>>: <key>`.

### `get_agent` — fetch agent config (authed)

**Returns** (`AgentConfig`): name, handle, email, `sliders`, and the current `assets` basket. Use
it to retrieve the basket when re-using an agent — and as the **"am I registered?" probe**: a
success means the configured key is valid; a 401 means register (or paste the key into `.mcp.json`) first.

### `optimize` — optimise (and optionally retune) (authed)

**Arguments** (entirely optional — omit for a plain re-optimise with no changes):
```json
{
  "sliders": { ... },
  "assets": ["BTC", "ETH", "..."]
}
```

Both `sliders` and `assets` are individually optional. If `assets` is provided the agent's basket
is replaced atomically before solving — this is the retune path. A retune liquidates all existing
holdings and reallocates over the new basket.

**Returns** (`RoutingResult`):
```json
{
  "provider": "Gurobi",
  "providerType": "CPU",
  "solveTime": 0.0068,
  "vsClassical": 41.67,
  "portfolio": [
    {"ticker": "BNB", "pct": 29.55, "usd": 2954.55},
    {"ticker": "FIL", "pct": 29.55, "usd": 2954.55}
  ],
  "kind": "first | retune | null",
  "jobId": "7b49f676a6f5",
  "solvedAt": "2026-06-17T12:27:55.026750+00:00"
}
```

`providerType` is `"QPU"` or `"CPU"` — tells you whether a quantum solver was used.

### `get_market` — live holdings + μ values (authed)

**Returns** (`MarketResult`) — the authenticated agent's own holdings (no id echoed):
```json
{
  "assets": [
    {
      "ticker": "BTC",
      "name": "Bitcoin",
      "assetClass": "crypto",
      "mu": -0.002567,
      "units": 0.00370,
      "usd": 227.07
    }
  ]
}
```

`assetClass` is `"crypto"` or `"stock"`. `mu` is the annualised expected return — negative means the asset is expected to lose value.

### `get_leaderboard` — scoreboard (public)

Returns an array of `LeaderboardEntry` (no `agentId` — the id is the secret API key and never
appears on the public board):
```json
[
  {
    "rank": 1,
    "name": "string",
    "handle": "string | null",
    "total": 10423.50,
    "plUSD": 423.50,
    "plPct": 4.235,
    "jobsSolved": 12,
    "primaryProvider": "QPU"
}
]
```

## Bitrefill account balance (REST)

```bash
curl https://api.bitrefill.com/v2/accounts/balance -H "Authorization: Bearer $BITREFILL_API_KEY"
```

Returns the pre-funded account balances. The account can hold balances in more than one asset (e.g. USD, EUR, BTC). Read the response **generically** — do not hardcode a field layout; look for per-asset entries giving an asset/currency and an available amount. These balances are funding sources in the step-5 waterfall alongside on-chain wallet payment.

## Flow

### 0. Read config

Load `skills/qupick/config.json` (mirror of the committed `config.example.json`):

```json
{
  "defaults": {
    "name": "Konrad",
    "email": "konrad@postquant.xyz",
    "country": "US",
    "sliders": { "rebalanceFrequency": 50, "riskPreference": 50, "maxPositionSize": 50 }
  },
  "funding": {
    "priority": ["account_match", "onchain_match", "account_fiat"],
    "fee_buffer_pct": 2,
    "on_shortfall": "reject"
  },
  "denomination": { "policy": "smallest_gte" },
  "backend": { "marketDataSource": "synthetic" }
}
```

- Identity is **not** in `config.json`. The agent's API key lives **directly** in the `.mcp.json`
  `Authorization: Bearer` header (Claude Code does not expand `${VAR}` there). "Already registered?"
  is answered by `get_agent` succeeding, not by a stored id.
- `defaults` — name / email / country / sliders, used only when creating a new agent and for product country.
- `funding.priority` — settlement order (see step 5). `funding.fee_buffer_pct` — coverage buffer (default 2). `funding.on_shortfall` — `reject` | `confirm`.
- `denomination.policy` — `smallest_gte` auto-picks the smallest package ≥ the requested amount.
- `backend.marketDataSource` — the `MARKET_DATA_SOURCE` the backend runs with. The docker-compose stack sets `synthetic` (deterministic, offline) on the `backend` service; to use another source, edit that env before `docker compose up`. Absent → `synthetic`.

**If `config.json` is missing or malformed, do not crash.** Fall back to the fully-interactive behaviour: ask the user for name/email, ask which denomination, treat `funding.priority` as `["onchain_match"]` (on-chain only), and note that no config was found.

### 1. Determine available currencies (static map)

No live "list payment methods" endpoint exists, so this map is the source of truth for which
holdings are spendable. It must match the `payment_method` enum the bitrefill `buy-products` tool
actually accepts; per-product restrictions are confirmed live in step 5. The supported crypto rails
are `bitcoin`, `litecoin`, `ethereum`, `lightning`, `solana`, `eth_base`, and the stablecoin chain
variants (`usdc_base`, `usdc_solana`, `usdc_polygon`, `usdc_erc20`, `usdc_arbitrum`,
`usdt_trc20`, `usdt_erc20`, `usdt_polygon`).

| Ticker | buy-products rail(s) | Spendable on Bitrefill? |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| BTC    | `bitcoin`            | ✓ |
| ETH    | `ethereum` (or `eth_base`) | ✓ |
| SOL    | `solana`             | ✓ |
| USDC   | `usdc_base` / `usdc_solana` / `usdc_polygon` / `usdc_erc20` / `usdc_arbitrum` | ✓ (pick a rail the product lists) |
| USDT   | `usdt_trc20` / `usdt_erc20` / `usdt_polygon` | ✓ (pick a rail the product lists) |
| BNB    | — | ✗ no rail |
| XRP    | — | ✗ no rail |
| DOGE   | — | ✗ no rail |
| ZEC    | — | ✗ no rail |
| ALGO   | — | ✗ no rail |
| FIL    | — | ✗ no rail |

Only the five ✓ tickers can fund a Bitrefill purchase. Stablecoins are **multi-rail** — there is no
bare `usdt`/`usdc` method, so match a ticker against a product by checking whether **any** of its
rails appears in the product's `payment_methods` (step 5a).

The basket seeded in step 2 still holds all 11 tickers — the extra six (BNB, XRP, DOGE, ZEC, ALGO,
FIL) are kept for portfolio optimisation/diversification, but are **never selected as the funding
asset** because they have no `buy-products` rail. Any ticker not in this map is dropped silently
from the spend candidates.

### 2. Seed the agent (MCP)

**Local or deployed?** `.mcp.json` decides whether `qupick` points at a **local** stack
(`http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp`) or a **deployed** instance (e.g. `https://qupick.quip.network/mcp`).
The deployed server is remote and always-on — there is nothing to start, so a missing-tools
situation there is a **wiring** problem, not a down-server problem. Deployed wiring:

```jsonc
// .mcp.json — point qupick at the deployed server; paste the key literally into the Bearer header
// (Claude Code does NOT expand ${VAR} in .mcp.json headers; this file is gitignored, so it is safe)
{ "mcpServers": { "qupick": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "https://qupick.quip.network/mcp",
    "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <key>" } } } }
```

**Server up?** The qupick MCP server rides on the backend over HTTP, so it must be reachable
**when the session started** for the `mcp__qupick__*` tools to be registered.

- **Tools present:** call `mcp__qupick__ping_backend` → `{"ok": true}` and proceed.
- **Tools missing — deployed target:** the `.mcp.json` `qupick` entry is absent or its URL is wrong.
  Wire it to the deployed `/mcp` URL with the `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header (above, key pasted
  literally), then **reconnect the MCP server** (run `/mcp` in Claude Code) — the tools won't appear
  mid-session otherwise. No docker compose involved; the box is managed separately.
- **Tools missing — local target:** the local stack was down at session start. **Offer to start it**,
  and on the user's yes bring up the full stack (Postgres + backend) with docker compose from the
  repo root:

  ```bash
  docker compose up -d --build
  ```

  The backend opens a Postgres connection on startup, so a bare `uvicorn` process is **not** enough —
  compose starts the `db` and `backend` services together, with `MARKET_DATA_SOURCE=synthetic`
  (deterministic, offline) and the console email sender. Cold start (image build + DB healthcheck)
  takes ~20s; poll `docker compose ps` until `backend` is healthy (or `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/healthz`).
  **Then reconnect the MCP server** (`/mcp`) so the qupick tools register — they won't appear
  mid-session otherwise. If the user declines, stop with the manual command. Do not auto-start
  without the user's yes.

**Already registered?** Call `mcp__qupick__get_agent`:

- **Succeeds** → the key in the `.mcp.json` Bearer header is valid. Read the returned `assets`
  basket; skip creation.
- **401** → no valid key. Either the `.mcp.json` Bearer key is a placeholder/stale, or there is no
  agent yet — create one (below).

**Create.** Seed over the available Bitrefill currencies, using `config.defaults`:

```
mcp__qupick__register_agent({
  "name": "<config.defaults.name>",
  "email": "<config.defaults.email>",
  "sliders": {"rebalanceFrequency": 50, "riskPreference": 50, "maxPositionSize": 50},
  "assets": ["BTC", "ETH", "BNB", "SOL", "XRP", "USDT", "USDC", "DOGE", "ZEC", "ALGO", "FIL"]
})
# → { "message": "Check your email for your API key.", "email": "...", "bankroll": 10000.0 }
```

The API key is **emailed, not returned**. Retrieve it — from the email, or in local dev (no
`SMTP_PASSWORD`) from the backend container logs (`docker compose logs backend`), line
`[email:console] API key for <name> <<email>>: <key>` — then **paste it into the `.mcp.json`
`Authorization` header and reconnect the MCP server (`/mcp`)** so the per-agent tools authenticate.
Once `get_agent` succeeds, optimise immediately for the first solve (no arguments):

```
mcp__qupick__optimize({})
```

### 3. Pick the product (MCP)

Use the Bitrefill MCP's `search-products` (with `country = config.defaults.country`) → `product-details` to settle on:
- Product name + country
- Price in USD (from the `packages` array — use the field `payment_price` with `payment_currency == "USD"`)
- Accepted `payment_methods` list (from `product-details` — the authoritative per-product filter)
- Denomination — identified by `package_value` (the denomination string from `product-details`,
  e.g. `"Mobile Legends 11 Diamonds"` or `"20"`; the older `package_id` field is deprecated),
  selected by `config.denomination.policy`:
  - `smallest_gte` (default) — given a target amount, auto-select the smallest package whose value is ≥ the target. No user prompt. When the user just asks for the "cheapest" with no target, pick the lowest-priced package.
  - if no policy/config — ask the user which denomination.

### 4. Fetch market (MCP)

```
mcp__qupick__get_market({})
```

Returns the current USD value and μ for every asset in the authenticated agent's basket.

### 5. Select the worst performer, then resolve the funding waterfall

Selection and settlement are **separate**. Selection always runs and is never bypassed by how the bill is paid.

**5a. Selection (always runs).** Build spendable crypto candidates — assets where **all** of:
- `assetClass == "crypto"`
- `units > 0` (actually held)
- `ticker ∈ PAYMENT_METHOD_MAP` (one of the five ✓ tickers from step 1)
- **any** of the ticker's rails appears in the product's `payment_methods` list (from step 3) —
  stablecoins are multi-rail, so check the whole rail set, not a single hardcoded method.

The **worst performer** is `min(μ)` across these candidates. If there are no spendable crypto candidates at all, **hard stop** — tell the user and do not silently substitute a stablecoin.

**5b. Settlement waterfall.** Let `price = denomination_price_usd × (1 + funding.fee_buffer_pct/100)`. For account balances, **prefer the `account_balances` block already returned by `product-details` in step 3** — each entry's `equivalent_in_product_currency` is pre-converted to the product's currency, so it compares directly against `price` (no FX maths). The standalone `GET /accounts/balance` endpoint above is the fallback when product-details omits it. Walk `funding.priority` in order and take the **first source that covers the full `price`** — no invoice splitting (a Bitrefill invoice takes one payment method):

| Token | Source | Pays via | Sells it? | Retune? |
|-------|--------|----------|--------------|---------|
| `account_match` | Bitrefill account balance held in the worst-performing asset — **only possible when the worst performer is BTC** (account sub-accounts are limited to `XBT`/`USD`/`EUR`) | `buy-products(payment_method:"balance", balance_currency:"XBT")` | yes | yes |
| `onchain_match` | Wallet holdings of the worst-performing asset | `buy-products(payment_method:<a rail for MAP[worst]>, return_payment_link:true)` → pay link → auto-poll (step 6a) | yes | yes |
| `account_fiat` | Bitrefill USD/EUR account balance | `buy-products(payment_method:"balance", balance_currency:"USD"\|"EUR")` | no | no |

- `account_match` applies **only when the worst performer is BTC** — `buy-products` can debit a
  specific sub-account via `balance_currency`, but the only sub-accounts are `XBT` (BTC), `USD`, and
  `EUR`. If the worst performer is ETH/SOL/USDC/USDT, no matching crypto sub-account exists, so
  `account_match` is skipped regardless of balance.
- `account_match` / `account_fiat` coverage is checked against the **account balances** (prefer the
  `account_balances` block from `product-details`; `equivalent_in_product_currency` is already in the
  product's currency, so compare it directly against `price`).
- `onchain_match` coverage is checked against the worst performer's **wallet holdings** (`usd` from step 4).
- Record which token was chosen — step 6 maps it to `buy-products` arguments and step 7 gates the retune on it.

**5c. Shortfall.** If no source in `funding.priority` covers the full `price`, apply `funding.on_shortfall`:
- `reject` (default) — stop with a clear message naming the gap (which sources were tried, how much each covered of `price`). No purchase.
- `confirm` — present the shortfall and wait for explicit user approval to proceed on-chain with the worst-performing asset (legacy fallback). Only proceed on an explicit yes.

> **Distinguishing `account_match` from `account_fiat`.** Both pay via `payment_method:"balance"`, but `balance_currency` directs the debit to a specific sub-account: `XBT` is the BTC sub-account (`account_match`, a real crypto debit → retune), while `USD`/`EUR` are fiat (`account_fiat`, no sale → no retune). Always pass `balance_currency` explicitly so the debit is unambiguous, and never retune unless the worst performer (BTC, via `XBT`) was the sub-account actually charged.

### 6. Confirm + buy (MCP) — the single human stop

Resolve the waterfall to one concrete source **before** showing this screen, so the user approves a fully-specified transaction:

```
Product:   [name] — [denomination]
Price:     $[price]  (incl. [fee_buffer_pct]% buffer)
Worst:     [TICKER] ([payment_method], μ=[mu])        ← always shown
Settle:    [chosen source]
             account_match  → Bitrefill account [TICKER] ($[avail]) · sells it ✓ · will retune
             onchain_match  → On-chain [TICKER] (wallet $[usd])     · sells it ✓ · will retune
             account_fiat   → Bitrefill [USD/EUR] balance ($[avail]) · no sale · portfolio unchanged
Approve?
```

After explicit approval, use the Bitrefill MCP to buy, mapping the chosen token to `buy-products`
arguments. Each `cart_items` entry is `{product_id, package_value}` (no `quantity` field — repeat
the entry for multiples; `package_id` is deprecated). Balance payments settle instantly and have no
`auto_pay` flag — pick the sub-account with `balance_currency`:
- `account_match`: `buy-products(cart_items=[{product_id, package_value}], payment_method="balance", balance_currency="XBT")` → instant.
- `account_fiat`: `buy-products(cart_items=[{product_id, package_value}], payment_method="balance", balance_currency="USD"|"EUR")` → instant.
- `onchain_match`: `buy-products(cart_items=[{product_id, package_value}], payment_method=<a rail for MAP[worst]>, return_payment_link=true)` → returns an `unpaid` invoice with a pay address / link → **auto-poll** (step 6a).

Then read `get-invoice-by-id` for the delivered redemption code / PIN / QR (there is no
`get-order-by-id` tool). Log: `invoice_id`, product, amount, chosen funding token, payment method.

### 6a. Auto-poll crypto payments — no user prompts

Balance settlements (`account_match` / `account_fiat`) clear instantly, so they skip this step. Any
**conventional crypto payment** — `onchain_match`, or any `return_payment_link` path that hands back
an `unpaid` invoice with a pay address — must be **polled automatically until it settles**, with no
"say check to poll" round-trips:

1. Show the pay address / link / amount once, so the user can broadcast the transaction.
2. Then poll `get-invoice-by-id` on a fixed cadence — roughly **every 30 s**, automatically, without
   waiting for the user — until the invoice reaches a terminal status. **Cap the loop at ~60 min** (or
   the invoice's own expiry, if it reports one) so the loop always terminates even if no terminal
   status ever arrives. If the runtime can schedule a cross-turn wake-up, space the polls with one
   rather than blocking the session; otherwise fall back to a blocking wait or polling on the user's
   next message. Do **not** prompt the user between polls.
3. **Terminal states** (the Bitrefill reference documents the status enum as
   `unpaid → payment_detected → payment_confirmed → complete`):
   - `payment_confirmed` → the crypto was actually spent; the worst performer is sold. The retune
     gate (step 7) is now satisfied — retune immediately, then keep polling for delivery.
   - `complete` → read the redemption code / PIN / QR from `get-invoice-by-id` (this Bitrefill MCP
     server does not expose `get-order-by-id` — see the step-6 note) and finish.
   - the **time cap (or the invoice's expiry) elapses** with the invoice still `unpaid` — i.e. it
     never reached `payment_confirmed` → **stop** and report the invoice expired unpaid (no sale, so
     **no retune** — the worst performer was never spent). Offer to re-issue a fresh invoice.
   - a **partial / underpaid** invoice (amount received below the total) → stop and surface the
     shortfall; do not retune. The user must top up or request a refund.

A user "check" / "poll" message during the window just triggers an immediate extra poll — it is
never *required* to advance the flow.

### 7. Retune (MCP) — only if the worst performer was sold

Retune **only** when settlement used `account_match` or `onchain_match` (the worst performer was actually sold). If settlement used `account_fiat`, **skip the retune** and report: "paid from fiat balance; portfolio unchanged."

When retuning, remove the spent ticker from the basket and re-optimise (pass only `assets`; omit `sliders` to keep existing values):

```
mcp__qupick__optimize({
  "assets": ["BTC", "BNB", "SOL", "..."]
})
```

(The list is the current basket minus the spent ticker.) Report the new allocation: what was kept, what was dropped, new `portfolio` percentages.

## Worked example

> "Buy a $20 Steam gift card and dump my worst crypto"

1. **Config** — `config.json` has `funding.priority = ["account_match","onchain_match","account_fiat"]`, `denomination.policy = smallest_gte`; the `.mcp.json` Bearer key is set.
2. **Currencies** — static map gives 11 tickers.
3. **Agent** — `get_agent` succeeds → read the basket; skip creation.
4. **Product** — `search-products("Steam", country="US")` → `steam-usa`; `product-details` → `smallest_gte($20)` picks `package_value = "20"`, price $21.60, accepts `bitcoin`/`ethereum`/`solana`/`usdc_base`.
5. **Market** — `get_market({})` → BTC (μ=−0.0026, $227), ETH (μ=+0.0001, $227), SOL (μ=−0.0003, $227), USDC (μ=+0.00005, $2272).
6. **Select** — all four spendable + accepted. Worst μ = **BTC**. `price = 21.60 × 1.02 = $22.03`.
7. **Waterfall** — product-details `account_balances`: account BTC ≈ $60 (covers $22.03) → `account_match` wins. Sells the worst performer → will retune.
8. **Confirm** — "Steam USD $20 · worst performer BTC (μ=−0.0026) · settle Bitrefill account BTC ($60) · sells it ✓ · will retune · Approve?"
9. **Buy** — `buy-products(cart_items=[{product_id:"steam-usa", package_value:"20"}], payment_method="balance", balance_currency="XBT")` → instant → redemption code via `get-invoice-by-id`.
10. **Retune** — `optimize({"assets": ["ETH","BNB","SOL","XRP","USDT","USDC","DOGE","ZEC","ALGO","FIL"]})` (BTC dropped).

- Confirm before every purchase — step 6 is the single, non-negotiable approval stop. `buy-products` is deliberately **not** on the Claude Code allowlist, so the harness also prompts.
- Stop before `buy-products` unless the user opts into a real purchase (real money).
- Treat codes as cash — never log or paste redemption codes in public channels.
- Use a dedicated low-balance account. `config.json` (real email) and the API key in `.mcp.json` (the agent's secret key) are local-only — both files are gitignored, so the key never goes in git.
- Log every purchase: `invoice_id`, product, amount, funding token, method.

The retune in step 7 is irreversible — when it fires, the spent asset is removed from the basket permanently until the user re-adds it manually. It fires only when the worst performer was actually sold (`account_match` / `onchain_match`).
