"""WebSocket endpoints — the live push channels.

`WS /agents/{id}` streams per-agent AgentUpdates (subscribeAgent). `WS /tv/events`
streams booth-wide events (new-agent splash → TV State D, rank reshuffles). Both
just drain a bus subscription queue to the socket; the MTM scheduler and the
optimize handler are the publishers.
