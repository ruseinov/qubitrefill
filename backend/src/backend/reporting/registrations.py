"""Registration digest projection — the registered-contact list for the team.

Modeled on ``persistence.leaderboard``: a typed, read-only projection of the
``agents`` table. The agent id is the secret API key, so — exactly as in the
leaderboard — it is **never** selected or emitted here; the query names its
columns explicitly rather than loading whole ``Agent`` rows.

Pure functions (no I/O except the passed session) so the scheduler and the CLI
share one code path and the whole thing is unit-testable without a mail server.
